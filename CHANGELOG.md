## 3.5.1 — 2026-10-17

- Engine: a successful cycle now clears any stale error in the health file
  (an old failure message used to linger forever after recovery).

## 3.5.0 — 2026-10-17

- New "Instant (30 seconds)" option for cloud checks — files added on the
  Proton Drive website or phone reach the PC within about half a minute
  (Proton's API has no push/notify, so polling is the fastest physically
  possible; one cloud listing takes only ~0.2 s, so 30-second checks stay
  light). Local changes were already near-instant via inotify.

## 3.4.0 — 2026-10-17

- **One release per update from now on**: every new CLI or app version gets its
  own GitHub release tagged `v<cli>-gui<gui>` (e.g. `v0.9.0-gui3.4.0`) instead
  of re-uploading into a single release — older builds stay downloadable and
  the releases list shows the app's progress.
- **AppImage filenames carry both versions**:
  `ProtonDrive-CLI-0.9.0-GUI-3.4.0-x86_64.AppImage`.
- The in-app updater understands both the new tags and the original `v0.9.0`
  tag, offers updates when either version is newer, and still verifies
  downloads against SHA256SUMS.

## 3.3.0 — 2026-10-17

- Slimmer window: minimum width 960 → **920**, default width 980 → **940**,
  with **zero horizontal scrolling on every page** at every allowed size -
  same guarantees as 3.2, 40px less window (sidebar 232 → 216, page margins
  tightened, pill padding trimmed 2px). The About title/version line still
  never wraps.

## 3.2.0 — 2026-10-17

- Fit guarantee: minimum window width set to 960 so **every** page shows with
  zero horizontal scrolling, and "Proton Drive for Linux" plus the version and
  engine line never break into two lines (Visit-the-website button moved below
  them). Verified against the real window styling on x11, with margin for font
  differences across distros.
- Default height 780: Home, Activity and About are fully visible without
  scrolling; remembered window sizes are floored to this no-scroll layout.
- Slightly tighter pill buttons so rows fit at the smaller sizes.
- Version history now ships in every GitHub release note (this file), next to
  the GUI version shown on the app's About page.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-10-17

- Text diet: shorter labels everywhere; detailed explanations moved to the
  README so the app stays quiet and readable.
- Tray recent-files menu, welcome state when signed out, 12 scan workers.
- Larger app and tray icon: the cloud fills the canvas at every size.
- Notifications carry the Proton Drive cloud icon instead of a lightbulb.

## 3.0.0 — 2026-10-17

- Friendly consumer redesign: status orb, plain language, pill buttons,
  light/dark/system themes, four-page layout (Home, Activity, Settings, About).

## 2.0.0 — 2026-10-17

- Selective sync tree, exclusions, conflict-safe behaviour, health telemetry,
  notifications, pause durations, verified self-updater, app-at-login,
  one-click menu install, background settings sections.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-16

- First release: two-way Google-Drive-style folder sync on top of the official
  Proton Drive CLI (systemd user service, never deletes unless opted in),
  packaged as reproducible AppImages for x86_64 and aarch64.
